		In mid-2015 Kiron, the international university for refugees, and Startup boat joined forces to create social impact and tackle the refugee crisis.
		We talked about the the real impact that startups can make on the refugee crisis, and how complicated it would be to create a network of social investors, government representatives and entrepreneurs that could push small innovative projects to really have a social impact.

		The team decided that their collective network and experience, combined with their consulting, investment and startup experience could be shared and exploited by everyone with innovative solutions to tackle social problems.
techno

		Kiron Ventures established a system with all the tools that an entrepreneur would need to have an impact
		<br><br>-	A network of individuals committed for the cause
		<br>-	Impact investment
